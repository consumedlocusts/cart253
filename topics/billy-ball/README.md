## Description

> _billy-ball_ is a portrait of an 8ball named "billy", draw using text "erasure". It is less a portrait, rather a subconscious desire to learn a mastery level of the game pool ('8 ball').

> Using the mouse, simply hover over the text rapidly to reveal a greyscaled drawing of the imported image of billy. If the mouse is pressed, a "transparent" red circle appears directed by the cursor. Using this feature and billy's appearance, locate the best point to hit him, call your shot...coming soon...
