## Description

- A story based, using original video, audio, noise effect visuals, and text-based expressions with playable aspects. It follows the biblical tellings of the locusts spawn and reign, but fairly loosely based on the actual story as I am neither specifically religious or familiar with the bible, yet I am using direct quotes for each opening scene for dramatic effect.

- Three scenes/video/audio/visuals separated from one another but relate as they are in the same universe. Most commands (scene change, progress to next scene) within the modes are executed by keypress, to return to the main menu, mousepress the final scene (when one cannot keypress anymore to see).

- Menu option has the three games/”variations”: wormwood, signs of the swarm, the end times. When the user hover over the texts, before clicking to initiate the scene/game, a subtext/caption under the title texts appears. Wormwood; “Shaft of the Abyss”, devastation. Signs of the Swarm; “Destroyer”, destruction. The end times; “God’s hate”, desolation.

- The MAIN MENU is an ascii style image of a locust, user is encouraged to fill in/draw it, just an extra interactive feature.
