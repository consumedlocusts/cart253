Ideas:
A story based, with video-told(like a very short film), text-based expression and  playable aspects. It follows the biblical tellings of the locusts spawn and reign, but fairly loosely based on the actual story as I am neither specifically religious or interested in the bible, but I am using direct quotes for each opening scene for dramatic effect.

-Three scenes/games/visuals separated from one another but in the same code like a playthrough “website menu options”.
-The MAIN MENUE is an ascii style imge of a locust but instead of “letters” or typical brightness style of ascii, its determined by line and line thickness (thin lines-brightnees, thick lines, darkness, or vise-versa in creating the image). 
-When the user hovers over the lines, then the actual options (three of them) are displayed as basic titles, when the user is done hovering to reveal all the text, they return to hover again to display the subtitles, then prompted to click on the text acting as a button to commence each scene/play? 

-The three games/”variations”: wormwood, signs of the swarm, the end times, secret 4th mode only revealed after all three have been played through. 
-When you hover over these title texts again, before clicking to initiate the scene/game, a subtext/caption under the title texts appears. Wormwood; “Shaft of the Abyss”, devastation. Signs of the Swarm; “Destroyer”, destruction. The end times; “God’s hate”, desolation.
