-Before entering the "frog" game scene, i want to use one of my previous that appears likewise of a "scope" (like a sniper scope). Link provided of my game (I am modding to combine these two games): https://consumedlocusts.github.io/cart253/topics/brace-yerself-json/

-Once the "scope" hovers over or finds the frog (have the frog generated at random each time, also it is only revealed if the scope finds it, the background starts fully dark, like a masking effect?) then we enter the "gamemode".
-Instead of a frog, it is a hand holding a spacey looking laser shooter.
-The background is a planet landscape.
-This gamemode is also in first person POV.
-The art style I want once we enter this game mode is pixel art, likewise of the game DOOM.
-What is actually "revealed" using the scope is also not a frog, but an alien creature.
-In this new gamemode, the flies are replaced with a smaller (same) alien creature revealed using the scope.
-The "tongue" is the laser's beam.
-The laser is not retracted like the frog tongue, instead its just a single "shot" each time per click.
-SLOW THE FLIES DOWN (or aliens at this point).
-Once the laser beam contacts/"kills" an alien it produces a laser noise/sound effect and draws a "boom" comic effect over the targeted alien
-After killing x amount of aliens (perferbly a small number like 8) a boss alien appears.
-When the boss is appearing/appears we enter a new game mode.
-To kill(win the game) this new boss alien (singular, larger alien creature) you must successfully shoot it x times (larger number like 20-30).
-The second gamemode is in the same POV as the original frogfrogfrog POV.
-The boss alien also shoots goop at the player (same animation as the tongue/laser beam) but slower than player.
-The boss alien moves side to side instead of disappearing (like the flies/small alien creatures).
-If you are hit with more than x goops (medium amount, 10-15 times? makes it harder) before defeating the boss, you are presented with a "game over" screen + "click to restart to the game" title.
-Assigned a healthbar once entered the boss gamemode (min 0, max 15, each goop from boss alien depletes 1 from healthbar)
-The screen changes to "WINNER" and plays something in the background + WINNER sound effect (thinking of the win gamescreen effects, maybe an edited video...).

Side Ideas;

-A random pitcher of beer appears during the boss battle (maximum appearance 3x and only triggered to appear when the health is very low), shoot it to regenerate health, during regenerate screen, a funny "gif" like video is played where the character is actually shown and is drinking it. Health potion.

-If the boss battle has gone on for too long, the boss creature starts spewing insults per shot after the prolonged gaming time is reached(insults are odd personal life sayings, I am unsure of what yet i.e "get a job"), and per insult the player's "morale" decreases by noticible incremenets eachtime, resulting in slower bullet/shooting speed(shown as a bar beside the healthbar).

-There is actually a beginning start screen where a video (edited real-time video in adobe after effects to resemble pixely game art) is played of the player being assigned the role of (thinking of the role name). once the video is starting to reach the end, text fades in "Click to start Game" and is fully on the screen once the video stops, player can start the game whenever they click or press spacebar during this time (might just make it anytime because of the inconvienice).

-Boss alien attempts to avoid your shots, but at very slowed speeds so its not impossible.

-The boss alien looks hurt (changes facial expressions) when a shot lands on it
