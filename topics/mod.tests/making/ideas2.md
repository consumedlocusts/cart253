based on If all you have ever known is winter, an EP by the band begotten
black metal

text baseed story line game that per task complete in a frame reveals a new frame (that follows chronologically the story).
pixel arty and ascii style
dynamic (the characters or whatnot are not super still) idk yet

theme: arctic exploration, tragedy, loss, atmosphereic melancholy, such looming feelings

rough draft:

unblinded by our exhauled fog,
her Polaris points above to the heavens

i could sleep for a thousand years
as if tomorrow shall never dawn

-

if all you have ever known is winter
lost in useless territory

you will crave
revaluation (a warm feeling)

and you never knew
because i never told you

we have been dead since a long time.
