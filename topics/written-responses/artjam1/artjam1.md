Shy guy response;

This shy creature, enthralled in the dark but displeased once illuminated, even blushing in embarrassment (in the lit scenario), is an impressive presentation of multiple possible emotive states. Having many opportunities to change an outcome was an entertaining and humorous experience. The oddity of its reaction, to what would be the opposite by a ‘regular’ organism, made this creature unique. With the first reactions already mentioned, the creature’s secondary mixed feelings about the red veil (drag the red side bar over the creature) also combine to result in different facial outcomes, showing the great complexity of emotions as a whole. Additionally, the fact that its facial components bob along with the mouse as it is dragged adds great attention to detail, making for a more personalized interaction with the figure. At first, I was confused as to what would trigger a response, a visual aid or label for the buttons (ie. “press” written on the red button/light switch, “drag” on the red corner) could be handy for those unknowing.

Character selector;

Played likewise of a character customizer, this game-like project was most impressive in not only the wide variety of selections to alter, but also the art-style it is given. Presented as a hand-drawn retro, pixel-art format reminds me of the original MS paint doodling (or the old faceQ mobile game). Another notable aspect was how symmetrical the character bits are aligned perfectly to the face. This was achieved with the use of grid patterning and alignment with such to optimize X,Y coordination, the creator noted they made this possible using an advanced custom method. The various sub-choices of eyebrows, eyes, hair and skin tone make this project highly professional, fun and interactive. I enjoy how the eyes blink at random, even the pupils follow the cursor, making the character feel alive. The addition of total randomization of the character feature’s (spacebar) seamlessly blends this project into a possible web gameplay scenario. A change of font, from the casual to one adapted to the theme (i.e. a bitmap font) would make the background environment blend with the character’s world thematically.

Campsite;

An artistically divine scenery, almost nostalgic with regards to the color palette, was a joyously interactive use of a day-night scenario. The active use of shifting day to night or timeline with sliding the cursor (mouseX,mouseY) was pleasantly seamless. The addition of the camp’s fire changing alongside said diurnal cycle was an eloquent use of interactive detail to an environmental setting. The drawings of shapes themselves are very composite to the background, the variations of clouds, the logs beneath the fire, etc. are placed soundly. Another example is the natural use of drawing with translucency to create a gradient effect, outlining the clouds, appearing quite realistically. Although unnoticeable at first, to improve the ‘camp-like’ wilderness, I would suggest the addition of trees to add depth in place of the mountains. I am curious to know if the location is based on a real-world landscape and if that place is near or far.
