Although it has been two weeks since, the game excels in storytelling, weaving a narrative that truly draws you in and delivers a memorable Halloween-style experience (scared). The writing style is engaging, and the language and font choices match the eerie aesthetic beautifully. The inclusion of a full/thought out story, multiple screens and menu options gives the game a polished and interactive feel, making navigation intuitive and enjoyable. Engagement through the story is too strong, with a scary ending that genuinely startled me... Undeniably indistinguishable (from the frogfrogfrog original) with such inclusions made me forget the project by such immersion. Winning/finding Sophie, felt emotional and rewarding as supported by well-crafted dialogue and, again, a consistent storyline. The addition of a multiplayer mode, (although I have not yet tested), is a very cool and ambitious feature that adds creative value and presents technical skills. The only minor issue lies in the ghost-capturing mechanic, which can be a bit buggy (and hard, or it is my fault) at times and slightly disrupts gameplay. However, the failing scene that follows is intense and worth the momentary frustration.

The game presents a stunningly clean aesthetic and beautifully serene environment, immediately immersing the player in the quiet world of a solitary frog’s perspective. One feature that I have yet to observe in other creations is the refreshingly unique mechanic of the leap-frogging between lily pads. Alongside the smooth clicking controls (especially during the lilypad mechanics) that feel natural and responsive, the on-screen instructions (eg. Z to capture flies) as you play make it easy to understand the game whilst blending in with the fantasy/enchanted theme. The overall presentation demonstrates careful attention to detail, the carefully curated color palette and the subtle animations bring the pond environment to life. The only challenge lies in capturing flies, which can be a bit difficult at times, slightly disrupting the otherwise tranquil flow. Still, this is a poetically stylistic polished and delightful mini-game that offers a memorable moment of the mod jam.

The game channels a classic space-shooter atmosphere with slick coloring and formatting,  a clean “space-age” aesthetic that instantly grabbed my attention. The starfield background is dynamic and fluid, with layered stars in subtle grey tones that create a rich sense of depth and movement. Gameplay is fast-paced and immediate as there is no fixed end point, just a challenge to beat your high score or die, which keeps the experience lean and addictive. Using the cursor as the scope for pointing and shooting adds the fun perspective-like twist that enhances engagement. I am wishing for more than three lives and perhaps a greater variety of space creatures to extend the challenge and “speedy”ness of the gameplay. At times I felt the asteroids blended too well into the background and shooting them whilst my eyes were focused on the background felt tricky, but that could be due to my computer’s brightness/colouring (or maybe it's intentional). Regardless, the game is a sharp, enjoyable arcade revival that nails the essence of high-score gameplays with the visuals and mechanics.
